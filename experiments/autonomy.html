  <h2>Intent</h2>
  <p>
    This experiment began with the goal of building an autonomous learning system.
    In practice, the work shifted toward understanding <em>why autonomy is hard</em>
    and where current learning paradigms break down.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>What Autonomy Means Here</h2>
  <p>
    Autonomy is not defined as goal-setting or agency in a philosophical sense.
    Instead, it refers to a system’s ability to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>adapt its learning strategy over time</li>
    <li>alter internal decision pathways</li>
    <li>respond to uncertainty without explicit supervision</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Observations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>increased flexibility often introduces instability</li>
    <li>credit assignment becomes delayed and noisy</li>
    <li>failure modes are harder to detect early</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Many behaviors that look like “learning” are actually brittle equilibria.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Outcome</h2>
  <p>
    The system did not converge to clean autonomy and that is the result.
    The experiment exposed the hidden costs of adaptive control and
    clarified which mechanisms require tighter constraints.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Status</h2>
  <p>
    Paused. Insights from this work now inform later experiments
    focused on stability, structure, and bounded adaptivity.
