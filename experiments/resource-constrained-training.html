  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    Much ML research assumes access to large GPUs, massive RAM,
    and uninterrupted runtime.
  </p>
  <p>
    Independent researchers and non funded teams rarely have that luxury.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Principle</h2>
  <p>
    Constraints are not a limitation but a forcing function
    for better system design.
  </p>
  <p>
    This experiment focuses on training strategies that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>actively release memory</li>
    <li>isolate training runs to avoid resource leakage</li>
    <li>prioritize reproducibility over throughput</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Key Technique</h2>
  <p>
    Instead of sequential model training within a single process,
    each training cycle runs in a subprocess.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the subprocess exits, all memory is reclaimed reliably.
    This avoids long-term accumulation issues common in deep learning frameworks.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    On a 32GB desktop system:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>peak usage stayed under ~7GB</li>
    <li>no degradation over dozens of training runs</li>
    <li>system remained responsive throughout</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    If an idea only works on ideal hardware, it is fragile.
  </p>
  <p>
    Robust learning systems should degrade gracefully in data, compute, and memory.
