  <h2>Why Document Failure</h2>
  <p>
    Benchmarks hide failure.
    Real systems reveal it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page captures recurring breakdown patterns that appear
    when models are pushed outside idealized assumptions.

<section>
  <h2>Common Failure Patterns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>silent collapse of internal representations</li>
    <li>overconfident predictions under distribution shift</li>
    <li>emergent shortcuts that bypass intended structure</li>
    <li>training dynamics that look stable until they are not</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Meta-Failure</h2>
  <p>
    Some of the most dangerous failures do not reduce loss or accuracy.
    They reduce <em>meaningful learning</em> while preserving surface metrics.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Design Implication</h2>
  <p>
    Robust systems are not those that never fail,
    but those whose failure modes are predictable and recoverable.
