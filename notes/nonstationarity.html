    Most real world data is not stable. Most models assume it is.

  <h2>The Assumption Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Many learning algorithms implicitly assume that
    the data-generating process is stationary.
  </p>
  <p>
    In practice, environments drift, regimes shift,
    and correlations decay.
  </p>

  <h2>Observed Effects</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>performance decay without clear warning signals</li>
    <li>learned features becoming actively misleading</li>
    <li>over fitting to transient patterns</li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Key Insight</h2>
  <p>
    Non stationarity is not noise.
    It is structure that moves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Treating it as randomness guarantees delayed failure.

  <h2>Research Direction</h2>
  <p>
    This motivates adaptive readouts, gating mechanisms,
    and models that track uncertainty rather than suppress it.
